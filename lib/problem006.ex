  Project Euler, Problem 6

  The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

  1**2 + 2**2 + ... + 10**2 = 385

  The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

  (1 + 2 + ... + 10)**2 = 552 = 3025

  Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural
  numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

  Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
  natural numbers and the square of the sum.

  The naiive solution here seems pretty obvious and straightfoward:

  (1..10).map {|x| x**2}.sum - (1..10).sum ** 2

  We'll keep it for now, because this kind of map manipulation is exactly what I
  need to learn in Elixir right now. However, looking at the problem overview
  document, there is indeed a problem with this algorithm as n becomes
  large. TL;DR we already know that instead of Enum.sum(1..n), we can simply
  calculate n(n+1)/2. It turns out there's a similar formula for sums of
  squares, and it is

  (2n+1)(n+1)n/6

  Also note that I've written my method to take a list and am passing in a range
  of 1..n, but the problem (and the shortcut show above) limit the problem
  definition to JUST the natural numbers from 1 to n, not an arbitrary list.
